yoey's notes because he doesn't know how to write an entity/state handler or something

probably want to designate some basic data per entity that feeds into a handler

entity spawn routine that takes an ID as an argument and handles checking out
the buffer and stuff

- ID 
- State 
- Direction
- Velocity
- Camera Position (X/Y)
- World Position (X/Y)
- Animation Step/Cel (animation based on state)
- Animation Timer
